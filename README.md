## CS444 Repository
This repo contains Homework and Project code from my CS444 - Programming for the Web class at Binghamton University in Fall 2024. Primarily implemented code based on questions of the topics described below
## Topics Included:
* Overview of main features of JavaScript and Typescript, including prim types, Arrays, Objects, Reg Expressions, Control Statements, Functions, Classes, Pure Functions, error Handling, TS literals vs JSON
* Asynchronous Javascript princples such as how to implement asynchrnous functions, event loop, run-to-completion semantics, callbacks for event handlers, async await, promises
* Utilizing Zod Validation library for user validation
* MongoDB implementation and concepts such as CRUD operations
* Basic methods of HTTP and how to use them, including GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, PATCH, etc. Properties of HTTP methods (Safe, Idempotent), when to use such methods, patterns of using HTTP methods (Post-Redirect-get), HTTP status codes
* REST Web Services and the features associated with them (HTTP messages, URI's, Representations, Links/HATEOAS, Caching)
* HTML, XML, CSS
* Brief introduction to React library
* HCI and principles associated with HCI, including usability, accessibility, user centered design, flexibility, user control, error prevention

## Class Syllabus

An in-depth understanding of programming for the World Wide Web: detailed coverage of
widely used language(s) for web programming, asynchronous programming, principles of web architecture, web
protocols, web design patterns, client-side programming, templating, server-side programming, a technical history
of the web, web security. Students are expected to have experience with a modern programming language and will be
assigned programming projects using current state-of-the-art web technologies. Results of this course include: 
* Have had exposure to some of the intricacies of JavaScript and TypeScript.
* Understand asynchronous programming.
* Have a solid grasp of the basic technology powering the World Wide Web.
* Have experience developing RESTful web services.
* Use modern client side technologies for consuming the web services.
* Experience in implementing programming projects of medium complexity.
